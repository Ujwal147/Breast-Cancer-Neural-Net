# Breast-Cancer-Neural-Net
Breast Cancer Neural Net using Tensoflow and Keras

This project uses tensorflow to create a neural network in order to classify Breast Cancer using the following dataset from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nancyalaswad90/breast-cancer-dataset

The model used involved only a single dense layer and an Adam optimizer to evaluate and produce the mse and mae and the results are as follows:
mse: 0.007768038660287857  
mae: 0.08564789593219757
